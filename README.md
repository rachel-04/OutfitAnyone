# üëó Outfit Anyone - Virtual Trial Room with ComfyUI Workflow

Welcome to **Outfit Anyone**, a virtual trial room that allows users to try on different outfits using a unique LoRA model trained with the "Outfit Anyone" ComfyUI workflow. This project leverages deep learning to provide a futuristic shopping experience, allowing users to visualize themselves in various clothing styles from the comfort of their homes.

## üåü Features
- **Virtual Try-On**: Easily visualize various outfits with a simple UI powered by the "Outfit Anyone" workflow.
- **Custom LoRA Model**: Trained a LoRA model using over 100 images, offering a wide range of outfit simulations, from casual wear to formal attire.
- **Easy Integration**: Utilizes AWS SageMaker, Automatic 1111, Kohya SS, python, Jupyter Notebooks for model training and deployment.
- **Realistic Simulations**: Generated outputs showcase the LoRA model's capability to simulate outfits in diverse scenarios, bringing fashion retail to a whole new digital level!

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **ComfyUI**: Streamlined the user interface for virtual trial room experience.
- **LoRA Model**: Trained on a diverse dataset for high-quality outfit simulations.
- **AWS SageMaker**: Utilized for scalable model training.
- **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: For model training, data preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Terminal Commands**: To manage workflow and troubleshoot during development.

## üì∏ Example Outputs

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- [ComfyUI](https://comfyui.com/) installed
- [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) account (optional for model training)
- Jupyter Notebooks

### Installation
1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/outfit-anyone-comfyui-workflow.git
    cd outfit-anyone-comfyui-workflow
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up ComfyUI:**
    Follow the [ComfyUI setup guide](https://comfyui.com/getting-started) to integrate it with this project.

4. **Prepare the Dataset (Optional):**
   - Add your dataset to the `data/` folder.
   - Run the data preprocessing script in `notebooks/data_preprocessing.ipynb`.

### Usage
1. **Train the LoRA Model (Optional):**
   - Open `notebooks/train_lora_model.ipynb`.
   - Follow the instructions to train your model using your dataset.
   
2. **Run the Virtual Trial Room:**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

3. **Use the ComfyUI Interface:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:8000` to access the virtual trial room.
   - Upload an image and explore different outfit options!

## üß† How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: The LoRA model is trained using a diverse set of images, enabling it to generalize across different body shapes and outfits.
2. **Model Training**: The model is fine-tuned using a combination of AWS SageMaker, Jupyter Notebooks, and terminal commands, optimizing for accuracy and performance.
3. **Outfit Simulation**: Through the ComfyUI workflow, users can select an outfit, and the model generates a realistic trial room image, presenting how the outfit might look on them.

## üìù Project Structure
Here's a breakdown of the key components of this project:
- `src/`: Contains the main code files and UI scripts.
- `assets/`: Stores images and icons used in the UI.
- `models/`: Pre-trained LoRA models (or instructions on how to download them if they're large).
- `results/`: Example outputs from the virtual trial room.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies for this project.


## üéØ What's Next?
- Adding support for multiple outfit categories.
- Integrating more advanced deep learning techniques for even more realistic simulations.
- Enhancing the user interface for a seamless virtual shopping experience.
